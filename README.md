## Summary 

This is a small python tool for doing task allocation using skills tags. It takes in two csv files and outputs a bunch of useful things, including a gantt chart of your task timings, as well as any skills gaps you have if you don't have enough people to meet your estimated effort required.

To get started, create a venv, then run the task_planner.py file once to get the template people and skills csvs to base your own on. Then you can create a call in a python file like example.py to point to your own files.
